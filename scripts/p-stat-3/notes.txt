üìùresults and some thoughts:

1. Shapiro-Wilk Test:
   - None of the groups (Control, Stimulation, 0.1MM Treatment, 1MM Treatment) are normally distributed.
   - Statistic = nan, p-value = nan.

2. Levene‚Äôs Test:
   - Variances are not equal.
   - Statistic = nan, p-value = nan.
   - Recommendation: Use Welch ANOVA or a non-parametric test.

3. Kruskal-Wallis Test:
   - Statistic = 3.0, p-value = 0.3916.
   - Conclusion: No significant differences between groups.

4. Tukey HSD Test:
   - Pairwise comparisons between groups show no significant differences.
   - All p-adj = nan.
