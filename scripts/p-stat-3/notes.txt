üìùResults and Some Thoughts - p-STAT-3

1.0.1 MM vs 1 MM

Mean difference = -0.2043

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is significantly lower than the 1 MM group, indicating that a higher concentration increases p-STAT3 levels.

2.0.1 MM vs ctrl (control)

Mean difference = 0.3064

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is significantly lower than the control group, suggesting that low-dose treatment decreases p-STAT3 activity.

3.0.1 MM vs stim (stimulation)

Mean difference = 0.0003

p-adj = 0.0882 (not significant)

Conclusion: There's no significant difference between 0.1 MM and the stimulation group, meaning the treatment has little to no impact compared to stimulation alone at this dose.

4.1 MM vs ctrl

Mean difference = 0.5107

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 1 MM group is significantly higher than the control group, showing a strong activation of p-STAT3 at high dose.

5.1 MM vs stim

Mean difference = 0.2046

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 1 MM group significantly increases p-STAT3 compared to stimulation, indicating a potent enhancing effect from the treatment.

6.ctrl vs stim

Mean difference = -0.3062

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The stimulation group is significantly lower than the control group, which could point to a suppression or regulatory feedback effect from stimulation alone.

General Conclusions:
0.1 MM treatment shows no significant change from stimulation but is significantly lower than both control and 1 MM ‚Üí suggests weak or minimal activity at low dose.

1 MM treatment leads to significant increases in p-STAT3 compared to all groups ‚Üí supports a dose-dependent activation pattern.

Stimulation alone reduces p-STAT3 compared to control ‚Üí might reflect transient dephosphorylation or negative regulation.

‚ú®These findings show that p-STAT3, like p-STAT6, responds sensitively to 17-AAG concentration. The high dose (1 MM) consistently boosts phosphorylation levels, hinting at a shared mechanism affecting STAT signaling through Hsp90 inhibition.‚ú®
