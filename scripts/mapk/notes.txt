üìùresults and some thoughts - MAPK

1.0.1 MM vs 1 MM

Mean difference = 0.0017

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: Although the numerical difference is small, the test still finds it statistically significant, with 0.1 MM slightly higher than 1 MM.

2.0.1 MM vs ctrl (control)

Mean difference = 0.1031

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is significantly lower than control, indicating MAPK is suppressed at this dose.

3.0.1 MM vs stim (stimulation)

Mean difference = -0.1948

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is significantly lower than stimulation, suggesting a strong suppression of MAPK activation.

4.1 MM vs ctrl

Mean difference = 0.1013

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 1 MM group is also significantly lower than control, showing that both doses reduce MAPK, with 1 MM having a slightly stronger effect.

5.1 MM vs stim

Mean difference = -0.1965

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 1 MM group is significantly lower than stimulation, again highlighting the strong inhibitory effect of the treatment.

6.ctrl vs stim

Mean difference = -0.2978

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The stimulation group is significantly lower than the control group, suggesting that stimulation reduces MAPK activation even before treatment.

üß™ General Conclusions:
Both 0.1 MM and 1 MM treatments significantly suppress MAPK levels compared to control and stimulation.

1 MM has the strongest suppressive effect, although even 0.1 MM shows significant downregulation.

Interestingly, stimulation alone reduces MAPK compared to control, and treatment further amplifies this effect.

The effect is dose-dependent but not linear, since the difference between 0.1 MM and 1 MM is minimal but still statistically notable.

‚ú®These results indicate that 17-AAG robustly inhibits MAPK signaling, likely by interfering with upstream kinases or chaperone-dependent pathways. The strong effect at both concentrations, especially in comparison to stimulation alone, suggests a potent regulatory role.‚ú®
