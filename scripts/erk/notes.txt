üìùresults and some thoughts - ERK

1.0.1 MM vs 1 MM

Mean difference = 0.0017

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: Despite the very small numerical difference, this comparison is statistically significant. 0.1 MM results in slightly higher ERK levels than 1 MM.

2.0.1 MM vs ctrl (control)

Mean difference = 0.1031

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group shows significantly lower ERK expression than the control, indicating suppression at this treatment level.

3.0.1 MM vs stim (stimulation)

Mean difference = -0.1948

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is markedly lower than the stimulation group, indicating a strong reduction of ERK in response to treatment.

4.1 MM vs ctrl

Mean difference = 0.1013

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 1 MM group is significantly lower than control as well, reinforcing that both doses reduce ERK signaling, with 1 MM having a slightly stronger effect.

5.1 MM vs stim

Mean difference = -0.1965

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: Again, significant suppression of ERK in the 1 MM group compared to stimulation alone.

6.ctrl vs stim

Mean difference = -0.2978

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: Stimulation decreases ERK compared to control, suggesting a baseline effect of stimulation on ERK levels, even before treatment.

üß™ General Conclusions:
Both 0.1 MM and 1 MM concentrations of 17-AAG significantly reduce ERK levels compared to both control and stimulation.

Stimulation alone reduces ERK, and treatment further intensifies this suppression.

The difference between 0.1 MM and 1 MM is statistically significant but biologically subtle, suggesting both doses are effective, with a marginal additive effect at 1 MM.

The pattern is identical to the MAPK dataset, which is expected, as ERK is part of the MAPK signaling pathway.

‚ú®These findings support the idea that Hsp90 inhibition via 17-AAG suppresses ERK signaling‚Äîlikely through destabilizing key components in the MAPK/ERK cascade. This suppression may underlie the broader changes seen in cellular responses to stimulation.‚ú®
