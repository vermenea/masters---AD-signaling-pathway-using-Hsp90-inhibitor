📝results and some thoughts:

1. 0.1 MM vs 1 MM:
   - Mean difference = -0.9013 (average difference = -0.90)
   - p-adj = 0.0 (since the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference is statistically significant)
   - Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is statistically significantly smaller than the 1 MM group, so the difference between these two groups is significant.

2. 0.1 MM vs ctrl (control):
   - Mean difference = -0.4049 (average difference = -0.40)
   - p-adj = 0.0 (since the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference is statistically significant)
   - Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is statistically significantly smaller than the control group, so 0.1 MM changes the level of p-STAT-1 compared to the control group.

3. 0.1 MM vs stim (stimulation):
   - Mean difference = 0.0043 (average difference = 0.0043)
   - p-adj = 0.9264 (not significant, p-value > 0.05)
   - Conclusion: The differences between the 0.1 MM group and the stimulated group are not statistically significant. This means that stimulation in this group does not have a clear impact on the level of p-STAT-1 compared to 0.1 MM.

4. 1 MM vs ctrl:
   - Mean difference = 0.4965 (average difference = 0.50)
   - p-adj = 0.0 (since the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference is statistically significant)
   - Conclusion: The 1 MM group is statistically significantly higher than the control group, suggesting that 1 MM has a significant impact on the level of p-STAT-1 compared to the control group.

5. 1 MM vs stim:
   - Mean difference = 0.9056 (average difference = 0.91)
   - p-adj = 0.0 (since the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference is statistically significant)
   - Conclusion: The 1 MM group is statistically significantly higher than the stimulated group, suggesting that 1 MM significantly changes the level of p-STAT-1 compared to stimulation alone.

6. ctrl vs stim:
   - Mean difference = 0.4091 (average difference = 0.41)
   - p-adj = 0.0 (since the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference is statistically significant)
   - Conclusion: The stimulated group has a statistically significantly higher level of p-STAT-1 compared to the control group.

General conclusions:
- 0.1 MM causes a decrease in the level of p-STAT-1 compared to the control group and the 1 MM group.
- 1 MM has a significant impact on increasing the level of p-STAT-1 compared to the control and stimulated groups.
- Stimulation does not show a significant difference compared to the 0.1 MM group, but has a higher level of p-STAT-1 compared to the control group.

✨These results suggest that the concentration of 17-AAG (especially in the 1 MM version) significantly affects the level of p-STAT-1, which may indicate changes in signaling pathways.✨
