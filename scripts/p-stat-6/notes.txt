üìùResults and Some Thoughts - p-STAT-6

1.0.1 MM vs 1 MM

Mean difference = -0.4435

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is significantly lower than the 1 MM group. This indicates that a higher concentration (1 MM) of the compound increases p-STAT6 activation.

2.0.1 MM vs ctrl (control)

Mean difference = -0.2788

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 0.1 MM group is also significantly lower than the control group, suggesting a reduction in p-STAT6 with low-dose treatment.

3.0.1 MM vs stim (stimulation)

Mean difference = 0.0019

p-adj = 0.9287 (not significant)

Conclusion: There‚Äôs no significant difference between 0.1 MM and the stimulated group, implying that at this low dose, the treatment has a minimal effect compared to stimulation alone.

4.1 MM vs ctrl

Mean difference = 0.1646

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The 1 MM group shows a significant increase in p-STAT6 compared to control, highlighting a clear upregulation at high dose.

5.1 MM vs stim

Mean difference = 0.4454

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: 1 MM treatment causes a significant rise in p-STAT6 compared to stimulation alone, confirming that high-dose treatment is potently activating the STAT6 pathway.

6.ctrl vs stim

Mean difference = 0.2808

p-adj = 0.0 (statistically significant)

Conclusion: The stimulated group has significantly lower p-STAT6 than the control group. This might suggest suppression or desensitization post-stimulation.

General Conclusions:
0.1 MM treatment does not significantly differ from stimulation but is lower than both control and 1 MM ‚Üí minimal effect at this dose.

1 MM significantly increases p-STAT6 compared to all other groups ‚Üí indicates a dose-dependent enhancement.

Stimulation alone lowers p-STAT6 compared to control ‚Üí could reflect feedback inhibition or baseline pathway dynamics.

‚ú®These results indicate that STAT6 phosphorylation is tightly regulated by the concentration of treatment. While low-dose 17-AAG (0.1 MM) shows limited effects, high-dose (1 MM) clearly enhances STAT6 activation. This supports a concentration-dependent modulation of the STAT6 signaling pathway.‚ú®
