# Influence of 17-AAG, an Hsp90 Inhibitor, on Signaling Pathways in Atopic Dermatitis

## Introduction

The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of the Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, on cellular signaling in the context of atopic dermatitis therapy. The research focuses on understanding how 17-AAG influences key signaling proteins involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.

## Methodology

### Cell Line and Stimulation

- **Immortalized Keratinocyte Cell Line (HaCaT):** The HaCaT cell line was used as a model for keratinocytes.
- **Stimuli:** HaCaT cells were stimulated with **IFN-γ/TNF-α** to simulate inflammatory conditions relevant to atopic dermatitis.

### Treatment Conditions

- Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of **17-AAG**, an Hsp90 inhibitor.

### Analysis

The phosphorylation status of the following signaling proteins was analyzed:
- **STAT-1**
- **STAT-3**
- **STAT-6**
- **ERK**
- **MAPK**

The activation of these proteins, as well as the role of Hsp90 acetylation (acLys284/292), was assessed in activated HaCaT cells using **immunoblotting**.

## Results and Conclusion

Soon...
