##Influence of 17-AAG a Hsp90 inhibitor on signaling pathway in Atopic Dermatitis

The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of the Hsp90 inhibitor on cellular signaling in the context of atopic dermatitis therapy.

The immortalized keratinocyte cell line HaCaT were stimulated with IFN-γ/TNF-α, respectively, and cultured in the presence or absence of 17-AAG. T
The phosphorylation status of signaling proteins, namely STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-6, as well ERK, MAPK, was analyzed in activated HaCaT cells cultured in the presence or absence of 17-AAG by immunoblotting.
